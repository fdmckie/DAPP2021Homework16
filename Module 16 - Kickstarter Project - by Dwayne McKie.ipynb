    "Kickstarter is a company that provides the space for independent artists, creative, innovators, and entrepreneurs to bring their unique projects to life. Kickstarter allows anyone to financially support the project through an online pledging system - this means; anyone can pledge a specific amount of money towards the funding goal of the project. Kickstarter projects (also called campaigns) are all-or-nothing -- meaning, if the funding goal isn't met 100% (or exceeded), the project campaign fails and no funding is provided. The stakes are high - but what is it about certain campaigns that make them succeed while others fail? \n",
    "\n",
    "You have joined the marketing team for Kickstarter and you are tasked with exploring the features of several campaigns over the past few years. You are responsible for looking at this dataset and pulling out key insights about the characteristics of Kickstarter campaigns that make them more likely to succeed or fail. The marketing team at Kickstarter has a limited amount of funds to devote to highlighting specific projects, and they want to highlight projects that have the best chance of succeeding (i.e. meeting the funding goal). Can you help them determine who that might be?\n",

    "Complete the steps below to take a dataset from inception to insights, for the purpose of answering the following two questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. What kinds of projects should the Kickstarter Marking Team focus their attention on?\n",
    "    2. Why should the Marketing Team focus their attention in that direction?\n",
    "\n",
    "After you have combed through the data, your group will put together a report (without visualizations), that clearly answers the two questions above. The Kickstarter dataset is posted to Canvas. Complete the code in the notebook below to complete the project. <b> You are NOT restricted to the steps laid out in this notebook to complete your project, You can conduct additional analyses. This notebook is everything you need to cover, but feel free to expand on these steps!</b>"

Your dependent/outcome variable is <b>STATE</b> - this is the variable that captures if the project was successful or not. In addition to exploring the relationships between your other independent variables, you want to pay close attention to the relationship between your independent variables and state. Follow the steps below to explore the relationships between your variables. In addition, you are tasked with creating a summary report (later, visualizations in PowerBI) related to your results.

    "By now, your group should feel very comfortable with the aspects of the Kickstarter dataset. You should have a firm understanding of what Kickstarter is, what the dataset contains, the characteristics of each variable, how the variables interact with each other, and finally, which variables influence the outcome of the Kickstarter campaign. Can you put all this information together to tell a story about the data? Your presentation should include clear answers to the two primary questions:\n",

    "    2. Why should the Marketing Team focus their attention in that direction?\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to these two questions, your presentation should cover the additional questions listed below. These questions should be easy to answer using the information you discovered above. When you are done, submit your completed notebook to me and have your presentation ready to present to the class.   \n",

    "1.\tWhat main category is the most profitable (highest amount of money pledged)? \n",
    "2.\tWhich main category is the most popular (highest number of backers)?\n",
    "3.\tWhich sub-categories are the most profitable and popular (top 3)?\n",
    "4.\tWhat are some of the characteristics of a successful Kickstarter campaign? \n",

    "* Start with the most important information (answers to the two questions above), and work backwards. The entire class will be working with the same dataset, therefore, we don't need to know the details of all your coding -- we just want to know what findings are most important to the questions. \n",
    "* Create clear visualizations. Make sure your audience can quickly and easily understand what your visualizations are showing. While you have a lot of options for how to style your visualizations, don't go overboard! \n",
    "* Make sure everyone understands what the visualization is showing; it should not have to stand on its own. When you present a visualization, you should be able to discuss what it means and what the significance is. \n",
    "* Use a single presentation format -- you can create a PowerPoint presentation, or show individual (or a dashboard) visualizations and talk through what they mean. Regardless of what you use, make sure you are only using ONE and not flipping back and forth between different software. "
